added to .gitignore:
node_modules
node_modules/
and .env

in package.json, added:
 "main": "server.js",
 and
 "scripts": {
    "start": "node backend/server.js",
    "server": "nodemond backend/server.js",
    "client": "npm start --prefix frontend",
    "dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\""
to always start the server first, provide le path to the server and client 
and to run at the same time the server and the client for us, so we don't have 
to get two separate windows for each.
