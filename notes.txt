added to .gitignore:
node_modules
node_modules/
and .env

in package.json, added:
 "main": "server.js",
 and
 "scripts": {
    "start": "node backend/server.js",
    "server": "nodemon backend/server.js",
    "client": "npm start --prefix client",
    "dev": "concurrently \"npm run server\" \"npm run client\""
to always start the server first, provide le path to the server and client 
and to run at the same time the server and the client for us, so we don't have 
to get two separate windows for each.

after adding the dispatch to the homepage to get all the products when loading the page, we nned to add a proxy to the client/package.json.
then, restart the application for package.json to be reloaded.
the dispatch will then be redirected to the port 5000
useSelector(state => state.getProducts):
    //this useSelector takes the state and returns its getProducts data
  //A selector is a function that accepts Redux state as an argument and returns data that is derived from that state
  //useSelector() subscribes to the Redux store, and runs whenever an action is dispatched

  productPage:
  fragment -> at the end of ternary operator to render the product details when loading false and error false

  cd client
  npm run build
  --> creates a mini version of our app (./client/build), easier to deploy in production)
